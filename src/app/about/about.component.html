                <h3>Building & Renovation</h3>
                <p>My hands-on construction background spans 6.5 years: 2.5 years roofing, 1 year carpentry, and 3 years landscaping - all while growing up. This foundation prepared me for my Pittsburgh duplex project, where I lived on one side while renovating the other. First side took 7 months to complete, then I moved over and gutted the second side to the studs. Currently rebuilding and securing permits for the larger renovations ahead. There's something deeply satisfying about transforming spaces where people will create memories.</p>

				<h3>Soccer Journey</h3>
				<p>18 years on the pitch shaped who I am today. Started as a forward at 6, evolved through center mid and goalie, finishing as a defender. Our team consistently ranked top 4 in state - a testament to dedication and teamwork. Currently on a 6-year break, but the lessons of strategy, positioning, and team coordination continue to influence how I approach challenges.</p>

                <h3>FPV Drones</h3>
                <p>My latest adventure began with more hiking and bonding with my pilot dad. Just mastered the controller in sims and got my Walksnail HD Goggles X - a tiny whoop is next! I'm drawn to the precision of freestyle flying and the creative possibilities. It's amazing how technology lets us experience flight in such an intimate way.</p>

				<h3>Semi-Pro Gaming</h3>
				<p>Semi-pro Halo Reach player where most teammates ranked top 1000 worldwide. I earned #3 globally for chain gun kills while our banshee specialist hit #1. What drew me in wasn't just the competition - it was the team communication and coordination. Like soccer, but portable. Gaming taught me that excellence comes from playing your part perfectly within a larger strategy.</p>
